# üåê VPN Privacy and Secure Communication

## Objective
To understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and ensuring secure communication over the internet.

## üîß Tools Used
- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)  
- Windscribe Free VPN  
- Website: [whatismyipaddress.com](https://www.whatismyipaddress.com/)  

## Steps Followed
1. Signed up for ProtonVPN free account.  
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client.  
3. Connected to a VPN server (Bangalore, India).  
4. Verified new IP address using [whatismyipaddress.com].  
5. Browsed websites securely to confirm encrypted traffic.  
6. Disconnected VPN and compared browsing speed & original IP.  
7. Researched VPN encryption and privacy features.  

## Findings
- ‚úÖ Original IP was masked successfully after VPN connection.  
- ‚úÖ Traffic encryption confirmed (HTTPS + VPN tunnel).  
- ‚ö† Browsing speed slightly decreased compared to normal connection.  
- ‚úÖ VPN provided anonymity by hiding my real IP.

## Key Learnings
- VPN (Virtual Private Network) hides your real IP and encrypts internet traffic.  
- Ensures privacy on public Wi-Fi and protects sensitive communication.  
- VPNs use tunneling protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IKEv2/IPSec.  
- Limitations: free VPNs may have speed limits, data caps, and fewer server choices.
