 Cyber Security Internship
 Task: VPN Privacy and Secure Communication
=============================

Objective:
----------
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

Tools:
------
- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
- Windscribe VPN (Free Plan)
- whatismyipaddress.com (to verify IP change)

Steps Performed:
----------------
1. Chose ProtonVPN as the free VPN service.
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client.
3. Connected to a VPN server (India - Bangalore).
4. Verified IP address change on whatismyipaddress.com.
5. Confirmed secure browsing with encrypted tunnel.
6. Disconnected VPN and checked difference in speed and IP.
7. Researched VPN protocols, encryption, and privacy features.

Findings:
---------
- Original IP Address: [Your Real IP here]
- VPN IP Address: [VPN Assigned IP here]
- Connection: Successful, traffic encrypted
- Browsing Speed: Slightly slower compared to normal
- Security: Improved privacy and data protection

Key Learnings:
--------------
- VPN hides the real IP and prevents tracking.
- Provides encryption via secure tunneling protocols.
- Protects data on public Wi-Fi and untrusted networks.
- VPN cannot guarantee 100% anonymity but adds strong security.
- Free VPNs are limited in speed, servers, and reliability.

Final Outcome:
--------------
Successfully connected and tested VPN functionality.
Documented results and screenshots for validation.
